The current feature list for the full 5-sprint project may be found in Scrum_MASS.ods. Maintain your status and planning here as before, in your choice of LibreOffice, Excel, or Google Sheets format (check with me first on any other format). Commit and push the updated spreadsheet in your cse1325/P8 directory on GitHub every week! (Please manage ALL of your code, and the Scrum spreadsheet, in cse1325/P8 for all 5 weeks of the project.)

A Sprint 1-specific user interface spec is available in User_Interface_Sprint_1.pdf, and guidance specific to the first sprint is in Sprint_1_Guidance.pdf. The latter document includes an image of the class diagram, which is also available for Umbrello in the UML.xmi file. Put none of these in GitHub.

The latest draft of the user interface spec for the full 5-week sprint is provided in User_Interface_Full.pdf, for those interested in planning past the first sprint.

Remember that the feature list and prioritization, as well as the user interface spec, may change between each sprint. If you have worked ahead and believe a change may affect that work, please contact me as soon as you can.
